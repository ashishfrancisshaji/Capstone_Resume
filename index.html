    <h3> About Myself</h3>
    <p>I love to code. I didn't realize this until I found myself staring at a coding screen, trying to build websites for projects at uni. I have grown by increasing screen time from 2 hours of Netflix a day to 10 hours a day of full coding. It was a great experience when I started out with C, C++, Java, and Python. Then I realized I didn't know a single thing about databases, frontend, etc. So I decided to try to master as much code as I can and go up the coding ladder. Thank you for reading this summary about me.</p>
