    <h3> About Myself</h3>
    <ul>
        <p>I Love to code. I didn't realise this until I found myself Staring at a Coding screen trying to build Websites for projects given at the Uni. I have grown by increasing Screen time from 2 hours a day of Netflix to 10 hours a day of Full Coding. First, it was a great experience when i started out with C, C++, Java and Python. Then I realised,I didn't know a single thing about databases, frontend, etc. So I decided, That i will try to master all Codes that i can do and try to go up on the Coding Ladder. Thank you for Reading a boring Summary About me. </p>
